### 🧠 Who Am I?

> 3rd-year Computer Engineering student @PICT, Pune  
> Building next-gen developer tools, real-time systems, and AI-powered platforms.

I craft **deeply interactive software**—from collaborative IDEs and password analyzers to intelligent matchmaking platforms. I focus on full-stack architecture with a heavy backend emphasis (FastAPI + Redis + Supabase), paired with production-grade React + TypeScript frontends.

I believe code should feel **as intuitive as conversation** and as **secure as your thoughts**.
